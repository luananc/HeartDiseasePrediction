# Heart Disease Prediction ML Classification

## Intro

This random forest classification model is developed based on BRFSS dataset available on Kaggle. Link to data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alphiree/cardiovascular-diseases-risk-prediction-dataset

The model is developed without adjusting the imbalance nature of the data through SMOTE, weights were used instead. This model aims to predict heart disease utilizing easily accessible metrics such as body measurements and behaviors to assess an individual's risk of having heart disease, which provides recommendations on whether one should seek formal medical examinations for heart disease assessment.
